# Hi, I'm Alfie 👋

I'm an **MSc Advanced Aerospace Engineering** graduate (Distinction, top student & best project) from the University of Liverpool.  
I like applying **AI and numerical methods** to real engineering problems: time-series forecasting, modelling, control and simulation.

## What I work with

- 🧠 Machine learning / AI – PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Optuna  
- 📈 Time-series & pipelines – custom Datasets/DataLoaders, reproducible splits, residual analysis  
- 🛰️ Aerospace & control – MATLAB/Simulink, PX4/Pixhawk, Kalman filtering  
- 🛠️ Engineering tools – SolidWorks, Teamcenter, FORAN, AutoCAD  
- 🐧 Workflow – Linux, Git, GPU/CPU management, LaTeX reporting
