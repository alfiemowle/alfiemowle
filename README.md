# Alfie Mowle

MSc Advanced Aerospace Engineering graduate (Distinction; top student and best project) from the University of Liverpool.  
I like applying **AI and numerical methods** to real engineering problems: time-series forecasting, modelling, control and simulation.

## Technical focus

- Machine learning / AI: PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Optuna  
- Time-series pipelines: custom Datasets/DataLoaders, reproducible splits, residual analysis, regression tracking  
- Modelling and control: MATLAB/Simulink, PX4/Pixhawk, Kalman filtering  
- Engineering tools: SolidWorks, Teamcenter, FORAN, AutoCAD  
- Workflow: Linux, Git, GPU/CPU management, LaTeX reporting

## Selected project

- [solar-activity-forecasting](https://github.com/alfiemowle/solar-activity-forecasting)  
  Time-series forecasting of solar activity using LSTM, Transformer, autoencoder and XGBoost in PyTorch.  
  Includes reproducible pipelines with fixed splits, baseline models, seed control, experiment logging and error analysis.  
  Based on my MSc dissertation, which received a mark of 94% and the Best Project award.
